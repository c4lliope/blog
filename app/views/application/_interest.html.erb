<div class="interest">
  <h2>Want your own self-destructing blog?</h2>

  <p>
  Let me know.
  If enough people think this is a cool idea,
  I'll turn it into something that anyone can use.
  </p>

  <%= simple_form_for(@interest || Interest.new) do |form| %>
    <%= form.input :email, label: false, placeholder: "Email" %>
    <%= form.button :submit %>
  <% end %>
</div>
